    <h1>The Necrolands</h1>

    <p>
      The Necrolands is the name given to the realm "governed" by the Deity of
      Undeath,
      <nuxt-link class="link" to="/deities/old pantheon/laimorkir"
        >Lai'Morkir</nuxt-link
      >, who was formerly
      <nuxt-link class="link" to="/deities/old pantheon/laidania"
        >Lai'Dania</nuxt-link
      >
      the Deity of Life.
    </p>

    <h3>Land of the Undead, refuge of the Hopeful</h3>

    <p>
      The Necrolands are a vast but desolate land covered by disease and
      undeath, but still teeming with bastions of life from the remnants of the
      Deity that formerly governed this region. As a whole, it is of little
      interest to Evil Gods, bit living in parts of it is feasible, which is why
      it is a good location for elements that seek the fall of evil gods to take
      refuge in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, it is a realm surrounded by evil, and some of the more restless and
      overarching evil gods will try to find those that oppose them no matter
      where they are. On top of that, the looming threats of disease and undeath
      seriously inhibits large scale organisation, even if it is possible, as
      proven by the founding of Living Hope.
    </p>

    <h3>Disease and Undeath</h3>

    <p>
      Two things mainly pose threats to Necroland Dwellers: the Miasma, and the
      undead.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Miasma permeates the air completely in the Necrolands, making it
      noxious to breathe. It causes weakening of the body and eventual disease,
      making it not only impossible to dwell, but also to grow anything. Without
      the presence of shrines, remnants of churches, and other structures or
      people capable of keeping the land alive, there would be no living thing
      in the Necrolands just because of the Miasma.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Undead is everyone, and Undeath is a reality that no one in these
      lands can escape. For this reason, its inhabitants tend to show very
      careful ritual and respect of the dead, to ensure that their rest is
      eternal. Within sanctified places, it is rarer for the dead to rise, but
      everywhere else in the Necrolands, unthinking abominations roam, hunger,
      and are nothing more than husks with a primal desire for survival. To
      travel in the Necrolands safely, one must be ready to defeat the Undead.
    </p>

    <h3>Where liches thrive</h3>

    <p>
      There are, however, undead creatures that set themselves apart from the
      rest by retaining their consciousness. Some had a particular purpose, and
      even undeath could not shake that purpose away. Some embrace undeath, and
      even inflicted upon themselves as a way to acquire immortality. Since this
      involves desecrating the principal good Deity and progenitor of all, those
      beings are usually particularly nefarious and ambitious.
    </p>

    <p>
      Liches and their minions thrive in the Necrolands. They have at their
      disposal the weakened remnants of the most powerful Deity, and the
      energies of Undeath itself surround them. They would alone make the
      Necrolands a worse place than Hell if they did not know of a way to
      overcome the sanctification of Lai'Dania's remnants, which acts as a
      barrier to them.
