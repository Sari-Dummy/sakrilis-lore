    <p>
      Sediro was the God of society, authority, leadership, and organisation. He
      promoted the responsability of each towards one another, the utility of
      following a leader and the order it can provide, and the qualities that
      make a good leader effective and morally just as opposed to tyrannical.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Leader was the first God to fall as the Old Pantheon and all non-evil
      gods began to fail. He was suddenly destroyed by an unknown culprit, and
      evil gods, unleashed, rose soon after; leading eventually to the end of
      the Old Age. For this reason, many point to the fall of Sediro as the
      cause for the rise of evil gods, and as the presence that prevented evil
      from leaking into the world so readily.

      His remnants can still sometimes be felt, at very disparate times. Very
      few priests, clerics and monks can make use of these remnants to call upon
      his power.
