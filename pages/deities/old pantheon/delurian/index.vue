    <p>
      Delurian is the Goddess of creativity, inventivity, imagination, art, and
      humor. She governs the things that are unique to intelligent life, the
      things that humanoids do that beasts do not, and patronises these
      activities and emotions.
    </p>

    <p>
      To those that ask for her aid, she does not grant inspiration, but
      reassurance, confidence and will. Her followers are typically artists,
      inventors, comics, bards, and generally social creatures who are a joy to
      have around.

    <p>
      The Inventress was never a powerful Deity, and has been left mostly
      ignored since the fall of the Old Pantheons. Evil gods have no worry about
      her, and those that oppose evil gods tend to focus on the more immediate
      endeavors of life and death rather than laughter and creative thinking -
      perhaps to their own detriment, considering how much these can be a factor
      to success.
