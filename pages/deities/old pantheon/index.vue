    <h1>The Old Pantheon</h1>
    <p>
      The Old Pantheon was the primary object of worship to the mortals of
      Fragmicia prior to the Unleashing. Composed of seven gods all representing
      important aspects of existence, the Old Pantheon provided guidance to all
      that would need it.
