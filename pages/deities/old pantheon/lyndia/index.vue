      The Free <br />
      Domains: War, Protection
    </i>

    <p>
      Lyndia is the goddess of Liberty and Coexistence. She values not only
      oneâ€™s ability to make their own choices, but choices that hurt other
      people and restrict them are viewed as evil from her perspective. The
      Goddess of Choice seeks the ultimate freedom of all through coexistence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her followers are usually self-determined but also valiant protectors of
      the agency and wellbeing of others.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Free has always taken humanoid form, descending upon mortals in varied
      appearances, and to this day, she still roams the world, though she is
      seen far less often. She was last seen at Living Hope just before it was
      destroyed, allowing many of its inhabitants to escape. She was wounded,
      but still lives, and can still be reached. She offers guidance to all, but
      mostly to those that fight and protect in the name of universal freedom.
