    <h1>Irindos</h1>
    <i>
      The Sage
      <br />Domain: Knowledge
    </i>

    <p>
      Irindos is said to be the first being to have realized and admitted the
      following: ‘I do not know’. He is the God of learning, humility,
      sincerity, and rationality.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those that follow him value rational course of actions, but without
      pretense and while always recognising that it is impossible to attain a
      perfect state of mind, and that mistakes are a necessary and unavoidable
      part of existence. They tend to be reliable and honest people.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Sage is still alive and well, but withdrawn from the world. He was one
      of the weaker gods, at least in terms of raw power, his strength is his
      philosophy. Still, there are some who can harness the philosophy of
      learning to attain great power, and there are even those clerics who can
      channel the divine power of Irindos’ Wisdom.
