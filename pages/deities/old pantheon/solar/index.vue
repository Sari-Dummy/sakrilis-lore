    <p>
      Solar is the Sun. It is also the Moon, mountains, rivers, storms, rain,
      the earth and the sky, and all nature that is unliving, the environment.
      It is perhaps the only Deity of the Old Pantheon that can be said to be a
      neutral one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Solar created the World for beings to live in it. It now reigns over the
      unliving environment, acting as the principal force of nature, and those
      that show it respect may ask of it favors in the form of powers or the
      prevention of natural disasters.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to Solar's neutrality, and how truly permeated with the world it is,
      it is the only Deity of the Sevens that has been left truly untouched by
      the rise of evil gods. It is even possible for an evil person to call upon
      its powers.
