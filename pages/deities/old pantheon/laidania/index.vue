    <h1>Lai'Dania</h1>
    <i>
      The Progenitor
      <br />Domains: Grave, Nature
    </i>

    <p>
      Lai’Dania was the principal Deity of the Old Pantheon, and the most
      powerful Deity of Fragmicia. It represented Life in every aspect: the
      magnificent intricacy, the ingenuity, the beauty of living existence. All
      living things are descended from Lai’dania, including every other god.
    </p>

    <p>
      Followers of Its Divinity are still in mourning to this day, as Lai’dania
      was long ago corrupted and transformed into an undead abomination by
      Sakrilis. However, as Lai’dania’s divine force still permeates every
      living being, and therefore, the world, the Deity's followers can still
      call upon its powers, and even commune with its presence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lai'Dania was one of the deities that existed among mortals. It appeared
      in many different forms, sometimes a combination of different forms, be it
      different species and races, man, woman or different or combinated
      genders, sometimes it would appear in the form of a tree or any
      non-animalistic living being. The one true characteristic of Lai'Dania was
      always that it was alive.

    <p>
      Lai'Dania now exists as
      <nuxt-link class="link" to="/deities/major evil gods/laimorkir"
        >Lai'Morkir</nuxt-link
      >, an undead abomination that is barely conscious.
