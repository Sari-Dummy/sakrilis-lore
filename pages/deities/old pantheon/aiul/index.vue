    <p>
      Aiul is often represented as a vague humanoid figure extending a clear
      hand, and is often referred to as The Hand. It is the deity of bonds
      between people, friendship, companionship, family, and love.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its followers usually recognise a universal bond between all people, and
      perceive beauty in everyone. The most devout followers of Aiul feel a
      unique love for all people.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aiul is the only unpersonified deity of the Old Pantheon. Aiul has no
      direct power, and does not directly speak to people, but lets them feel
      its presence and its emotions. Aiul only manifests through its followers,
      and thus can only be affected by affecting its followers.
