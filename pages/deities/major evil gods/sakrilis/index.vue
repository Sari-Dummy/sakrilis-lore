    <h1>Sakrilis</h1>

    <p>
      Sakrilis is the God of Domination, Control, power over others. He is the
      most powerful evil Deity.
    </p>

    <h3>The Tyrant God</h3>

    <p>
      He takes the form of a great humanoid figure, draped in ornamental armour
      and clothes. The weapon he wields was forged by
      <nuxt-link class="link" to="/deities/major evil gods/the dark monarch"
        >the Dark Monarch</nuxt-link
      >, and is said to be a weapon more effective at putting someone under his
      command than it is at defeating them.
    </p>

    <p>
      He seeks the total domination of the world, to rule all directly. His
      deeper motives, if there are any, are unknown. The entirety of his focus
      is devoted to ensuring that he is obeyed, and that dissenters are dealt
      with in a swift manner.
    </p>

    <h3>Society of the Ruled</h3>

    <p>
      Sakrilis' society is highly hierarchical, and it is entirely devoted to
      increased domination, either through conquest or reinforcing already
      established power, particularly if it empowers the God himself. Any who
      challenges authority in this society is swiftly punished.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most people under the command of Sakrilis are slaves with no other choice
      than to obey. Their conditions of living are decent enough as long as they
      obey, and a game of incentives is used on every person under the Tyrant's
      rule to increase productivity, obedience, cohesion, and to acquire better
      officers and commanders from those that stand out.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are also many who follow Sakrilis out of their own desire to do so.
      Some follow him because they appreciate strong rule and wish the supposed
      stability that Sakrilis will provide, particularly in a world so uncertain
      as it is now. Others have joined his ranks because it grants them an
      opportunity to acquire more power than ever, but beware those ambitious
      enough to challenge the God himself, they rarely survive, and it usually
      fortunate if they don't.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rest of his willing followers is mainly composed of a cult-like
      following who believe that, even if his intentions are unknown, his deeper
      motives are in fact good, and that he will bring upon all the perfect
      society once total rules has been established. Sakrilis strokes these
      beliefs; whether it is because they are true or because it grants him more
      reliable followers is unknown.
